# Oil's Effect on S&P 500 Prices
 
In this project my group and I decided to look at Oil's Effect on S&P 500 prices over time. Given oil and S&P 500 prices over the span of 2014 to 2023, we hoped to predict S&P 500 price based on the oil price at a given time. We would accomplish this by creating a linear regression model.
